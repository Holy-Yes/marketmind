It defines the visual language, interaction patterns, component system, and user experience standards required to bring the MarketMind Generative AI platform to life across web and mobile surfaces.1.1 ScopeVisual identity and design system: colour palette, typography, spacing, elevation, iconographyInterface architecture and layout specifications for the Generation Canvas and all seven modulesInteraction design patterns for AI streaming, agent pipelines, and real-time generation statesComponent library specifications with all states, variants, and animation requirementsAccessibility, responsiveness, and performance design requirementsDesign deliverables list, developer handoff requirements, and risk register1.2 Design GoalsGoalDesign PrincipleSuccess MetricGeneration feels aliveStream output word-by-word with visible motion and real-time cursorUser perceives generation as immediate and intelligentContext always visibleSurface all four active context layers on every generation viewUsers understand why the output was generated this wayZero template feelNo dropdowns, no fill-in-the-blank forms anywhere in the productUsers describe goals in natural language exclusivelySpeed is a featureShow progress for every generation stage from click to completeTime-to-perception-of-completion under 1 second from clickTrust through transparencyWhy This panel on every output with Outcome Memory audit trailUsers can inspect and toggle every AI decision madeCompounding intelligenceInterface surfaces how Outcome Memory grows and improves over timeUsers feel the platform becomes more valuable the longer they use itSECTION 02 Design System02 Design SystemThe MarketMind design system is a comprehensive token-based system covering colour, typography, spacing, elevation, and iconography. All values are expressed as CSS custom properties and as a companion JSON token file for programmatic consumption by engineering teams.2.1 Colour PaletteThe palette is built around a deep navy primary with an intelligence-blue accent. It conveys trust, precision, and technology without feeling cold or clinical. All colour decisions are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant at minimum.2.1.1 Core TokensTokenHex ValueUsageContrast On White--color-primary#0D1B2EPage backgrounds, deepest surface13.2:1 AAA--color-navy-mid#162540Sidebar backgrounds, secondary surfaces11.4:1 AAA--color-navy-light#1E3A5FCard backgrounds, section headers9.1:1 AAA--color-accent#2F80EDCTAs, links, active states, streaming cursor4.5:1 AA--color-accent-bright#4F9EFFHover accents, chip text, badge labels3.8:1 AA Large--color-cyan#22D3EEProgress bars, highlight accents, gradient end3.2:1 AA Large--color-surface-base#FFFFFFCard surfaces, modal backgrounds—--color-surface-raised#F8FAFCAlternating table rows, sidebar panels—--color-surface-ai#EBF4FFAI output panels, generation result areas—--color-surface-input#F0F7FFContext input panel background—--color-border#BFDBFECard borders, table borders, dividers—--color-text-primary#1E293BHeadings, high-emphasis body text12.6:1 AAA--color-text-secondary#475569Standard body, labels, descriptions7.4:1 AAA--color-text-muted#64748BTimestamps, metadata, helper text4.6:1 AA--color-success#059669Published states, positive signals, Hot tier4.5:1 AA--color-warning#D97706Medium lead scores, generation warnings3.1:1 AA Large--color-error#DC2626Failed generation, spam flags, Cold tier4.5:1 AA2.1.2 Semantic Colour UsageContextColour TokenApplicationLead score — Hot--color-success #059669Score ring fill, tier badge, next action card borderLead score — Warm--color-warning #D97706Score ring fill, tier badgeLead score — Cool--color-accent #2F80EDScore ring fill, tier badgeLead score — Cold--color-text-muted #64748BScore ring fill, tier badgeAI generation — streaming--color-accent #2F80EDOutput panel border, cursor, progress barAI generation — complete--color-success #059669Output panel border, confirmation tickAI generation — failed--color-error #DC2626Output panel border, error message, retry buttonOutcome Memory — active--color-accent-bright #4F9EFFPulsing chip, rule count badge, Why This panelSpam score — safe--color-success #059669Score bar fill below threshold 20Spam score — risk--color-error #DC2626Score bar fill above threshold 402.2 TypographyAll body and UI type is set in Calibri (universally available).

All padding, margin, and gap values are multiples of 4px. The Generation Canvas uses 24px as its core guttering unit. No arbitrary spacing values are permitted in component implementations.TokenValuePrimary Usage--space-14pxTight internal padding, icon-to-label gap, badge padding vertical--space-28pxChip horizontal padding, badge padding, small button padding vertical--space-312pxButton padding vertical, input field padding vertical--space-416pxCard internal padding, list item padding, form field gap--space-624pxCanvas gutters, section spacing within panels, grid gap--space-832pxCard-to-card gap, major section separation within modules--space-1248pxModule header height, top-level page padding, hero section padding--space-1664pxBetween major page sections, module separator spacing--space-2496pxCover page padding, hero section vertical rhythm2.4 Border RadiusTokenValueApplied To--radius-sm4pxBadges, tags, chips, code blocks, small status indicators--radius-md8pxInput fields, secondary buttons, table cells, dropdown items--radius-lg12pxCards, panels, modals, notification toasts--radius-xl16pxGeneration Canvas panels, AI sidebar, competitor cards--radius-2xl24pxHero cards, module entry cards, feature call-outs--radius-full9999pxPill buttons, score rings, avatar circles, toggle switches2.5 Elevation and ShadowLevelCSS Box ShadowApplied ToLevel 0 — FlatnoneFlat table backgrounds, inline elements, disabled surfacesLevel 1 — Raised0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)Cards at rest, sidebar panels, table rowsLevel 2 — Floating0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.10)Dropdowns, tooltips, hover preview cardsLevel 3 — Modal0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)Modals, generation preview overlays, drawersLevel 4 — Overlay0 16px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)Command palette, context menus, full-screen overlays2.6 IconographyAll icons are sourced from the Lucide icon library. Three custom icon sets are required beyond the standard library:Standard UI icons: Lucide React, stroke-width 1.5, 20x20px for controls, 16x16px for inline useNavigation icons: Lucide React, 20px, filled variant for active nav statesAI status icons: Custom animated SVG set — four states required (Thinking, Streaming, Complete, Failed)Module icons: Custom 24px outlined icons for each of the seven generation modulesOutcome Memory icon: Custom pulsing brain icon with particle animation indicating active learningAgent step icons: Custom 16px icons for each agent pipeline step state (Pending, Running, Complete, Failed)SECTION 03 Layout Architecture03 Layout Architecture3.1 Application ShellThe MarketMind application shell is a four-zone layout that persists across all modules. All zones are present simultaneously on desktop (1280px+). The AI Activity Sidebar becomes a bottom sheet on mobile.

It appears when a user initiates any generation action and is the primary output surface for all seven modules. Its split-screen design makes context and output visible simultaneously.RATIODefault split: 40% Context Input Panel (left) | 60% Live Generation Panel (right). User can drag the central divider. Canvas remembers last position per module. On mobile: stacked vertically, context panel auto-collapses after generation begins.Context Input Panel (left, 40%)Full-height panel with 24px internal padding and --color-surface-input backgroundProduct Details field: large textarea, minimum 3 rows, maximum 12 rows auto-expanding, placeholder guides with contextual example for each moduleGoal Selector: horizontal pill button group with four options (Awareness / Conversion / Retention / Engagement), single-select, pill fills accent blue when activePlatform Selector: icon-forward pill group with platform logos (Instagram / LinkedIn / Google / Email / Sales Meeting), single-selectTone Selector: five-option pill group (Professional / Playful / Bold / Empathetic / Urgent), single-selectBrand Voice Toggle: large toggle switch with ChromaDB status indicator showing count of indexed content pieces; click opens brand voice upload modalOutcome Memory Indicator: animated chip showing count of active rules conditioning this generation; click expands rule detail overlayGenerate Button: full-width, 48px height, --color-accent background, white text, loading shimmer on hover, enters loading state within 50ms of clickLive Generation Panel (right, 60%)Streaming Output Window: full-width text area with --color-surface-ai background, --type-ai-output font style, blinking accent-blue cursor at position of last rendered tokenVariant Tabs: three tabs labelled Variant 1, Variant 2, Variant 3 appear after first generation completes; all three variants pre-rendered but hidden until tab is selectedWhy This Panel: collapsible accordion below each output; shows top 3 Outcome Memory rules with confidence percentage bars and outcome countRegenerate With Notes: inline text input appearing below output after completion, placeholder ‘Make it shorter / change the tone / use a more urgent opening’, triggers regeneration with instruction appliedAction Bar: sticky bottom bar sliding up on generation complete; contains Copy, Save to Library, Publish (where applicable), Export as PDF buttonsAgent Progress Tracker: for multi-step pipelines, a vertical step tracker alongside the output shows each agent step with Pending / Running / Complete / Failed status3.3 Navigation StructureThe seven primary modules are listed in the left navigation sidebar.
